Beer aging,cellaring and collecting has become big business. The explosion of craft beer and collectors of craft beer in Australia has turned this into a multi-million-dollar business. Secondary markets exceed that value by a factor of 10. Collectors are looking for a simple, fully integrated and portable way to check their collection. They are looking for a way to compare, to identify what they have when shopping or trading, and when they acquired it. They also look to set rules around consumption and their own best before dates that are informed but not dictated by the community.

These collections vary in size, from 50 very rare bottles under a sink to walk in coolers with thousands of bottles on offer. Potential users of this toolset are sick of non-integrated and manual data entry practices.
Many apps are focused on trading or rating rather than the act of cellaring.
Some existing examples: that all miss the mark in one way or another....
